# Basic usage

As a guest user you cannot do much. Viewing and searching threads and messages made by other users is within your powers, but creating new threads and messages requires you to [sign in](https://hy-forum.herokuapp.com/login).

As a normal (signed in) user you gain the ability to create new threads in existing topics, and also post new messages in any existing threads. You can also edit and delete your own messages.

Many actions, such as creating new topics, and editing or deleting threads and messages made by other users, is something that requires special privileges (given by an [admin user](admin.md)).
